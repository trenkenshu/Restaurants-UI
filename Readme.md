The depth of flavours and selections played well with each other . The chef made sure to create food that fit in with some of my restrictions due to medical problems. The servers are very welcoming, spent the time to explain the menu and gave wonderful suggestions. Service impeccable. The desserts are works of art in looks and taste. Cocktail suggestions were spot on and a delight.",

While the food was good, the pasta was well cooked, and the service was adequate - there were just too many people crammed into this small restaurant. We sat a two-top right next to the large open window to the front patio, after sidling in between tightly crammed tables and encouraging the table next to us to remove their purses from our seats and hold them on their laps. The small space was made a bit more uncomfortable by having very large format menus. If the physical size of the menu is greater than the distance between tables - it makes things extra challenging. In addition, the poor staff had to try to get in and around the restaurant with essentially no extra space at the serving stations, making things rough to avoid a bit of jostling. ",

We had to order three items twice, including sugar for iced tea -- which a waiter brought but then returned a little while later to take back again (when we weren't finished using it yet). They're also eager to clear your plates as quickly as possible (even while you're still eating). We've been giving this place another shot every year or so since it opened, hoping it would get its act together, but no more ",
